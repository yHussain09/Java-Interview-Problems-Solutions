/**
 * Objective:
 *
 * Pick the packages from the heaviest to the lightest one.
 *
 * Rules:
 *
 * You work in an automated factory that controls a robotic arm to move packages. The
 * arm can pick packages from the conveyor belts to from a stack of packages.
 *
 * The packages are sorted from the heaviest to the lightest on each of the conveyor
 * belts. Your objective is to pick the heaviest package among the 3 conveyor belts to
 * move it on stack.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * Implement the method solve(weight0, weight1, weight2) that takes 3 integer
 * arguments: weight0, weight1, weight2. These values represent the weight of the
 * packages available on the conveyor belts with respective index 0, 1 and 2. When a
 * conveyor belt is empty, the value is 0.
 *
 * The method must return the index of conveyor belt that has the heaviest package.
 * For example, if the values for weight0, weight1 and weight2 are 85, 100 and 90, then
 * the expected answer is 1. In case of equality, any correct answer is accepted.
 *
 * The method solve(weight0, weight1, weight2) will be called successively until all the
 * conveyor belts are empty.
